        { type: 'p', text: "The human brain is wired for one thing: survival. And survival prefers comfort. Your ancestors who sought comfort—warm caves, abundant food, minimal risk—lived to pass on their genes. The risk-takers? Many didn't make it. So your brain is hardwired to avoid discomfort. But here's the cruel irony: every significant achievement in history lies on the other side of fear and discomfort." },

        { type: 'h3', text: "The Comfort Trap" },
        { type: 'p', text: "Comfort is seductive. It whispers, 'You've worked hard. You deserve to relax.' And yes, recovery is essential. But there's a difference between strategic rest and defaulting to the path of least resistance. Most people confuse the two. They avoid difficult conversations. They skip the workout. They choose Netflix over the business plan they've been procrastinating on for months." },
        { type: 'p', text: "The result? You wake up at 40 and realize you've been sleepwalking through life. Your dreams are still dreams. Your potential is still theoretical. You're comfortable, sure—but you're also deeply unfulfilled. Comfort traded for regret is a bad deal." },

        { type: 'p', text: "David Goggins speaks of 'callousing the mind.' By voluntarily doing hard things—cold showers, early morning runs, difficult conversations—you raise your pain tolerance. You become undeniable. Not because you're naturally gifted, but because you've trained yourself to keep moving when everyone else quits." },

        { type: 'p', text: "Goggins ran 100-mile ultramarathons with broken bones. Not because he's masochistic, but because he understood a fundamental truth: **the only way to grow is to consistently place yourself in situations that demand more than you think you can give**. The callouses form. The threshold rises. What once felt impossible becomes routine." },

        { type: 'h3', text: "The 40% Rule" },
        { type: 'p', text: "Goggins also introduced the 40% Rule: when your mind is telling you you're done, you're only 40% done. Your brain is a protection mechanism. It throws up warning signs long before you're in actual danger. That voice saying 'you can't'? It's lying. It's trying to conserve energy, avoid embarrassment, keep you safe. But safe doesn't build empires." },
        { type: 'p', text: "Think about the last time you quit something. Were you actually at your physical limit, or did you just listen to the voice? The answer is uncomfortable, but honest self-assessment rare." },

        { type: 'p', text: "**Cold Exposure**: End your shower with 30 seconds of cold water. It sucks. Do it anyway. You're training your nervous system to stay calm under acute stress." },
        { type: 'p', text: "**Early Mornings**: Wake up one hour earlier than necessary. Use that hour for something that matters—reading, exercise, planning. You're stealing time back from entropy." },

        { type: 'p', text: "**Physical Challenge**: Sign up for something that scares you. A marathon. A Spartan Race. A boxing match. Give yourself a non-negotiable deadline to train for." },
