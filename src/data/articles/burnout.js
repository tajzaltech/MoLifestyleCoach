        { type: 'p', text: "It starts with a subtle fatigue. Not the kind that sleep fixes, but a dullness in your cognitive edge. High performers are often the last to realize they are burning out because their 'baseline' of stress is already so high. What once felt like productive intensity now feels like you're running on fumes. The alarm goes off, and instead of jumping into action, you hit snooze—not because you're lazy, but because your system is screaming for relief." },

        { type: 'h3', text: "The Biological Cost of Ambition" },
        { type: 'p', text: "Your nervous system wasn't designed for 12-hour sprints seven days a week. When cortisol remains elevated for too long, it begins to degrade the very neural pathways required for complex decision-making. We call this 'The Fog'. It's not just tiredness—it's a measurable decline in executive function. Studies show that chronic stress reduces the volume of the prefrontal cortex, the area responsible for planning, decision-making, and emotional regulation." },

        { type: 'p', text: "High achievers wear their exhaustion like a badge of honor. 'I'll sleep when I'm dead,' they say. But the irony is dark: chronic burnout accelerates biological aging. Your telomeres shorten. Inflammation markers rise. You're literally burning years off your life in pursuit of success. The cost is invisible until it's catastrophic—a heart attack at 45, a breakdown in the boardroom, relationships shattered by irritability you can't control." },

        { type: 'h3', text: "The Three Stages of Burnout" },
        { type: 'p', text: "Stage 1: **The Honeymoon**. You're energized by new challenges. Working late feels like dedication. You tell yourself, 'This is temporary.' But months pass, and 'temporary' becomes your new normal." },
        { type: 'p', text: "Stage 2: **The Grind**. Coffee no longer works. You're irritable. Small setbacks feel insurmountable. You start missing workouts, eating poorly, skipping social events. Your relationships suffer. You're physically present but emotionally absent." },
        { type: 'p', text: "Stage 3: **The Crash**. You can't get out of bed. Even the thought of checking email triggers anxiety. This is where people quit their jobs without a plan, implode their marriages, or worse. This is the danger zone." },

        { type: 'h3', text: "Redesigning Your Protocol" },
        { type: 'p', text: "Recovery is not a luxury; it is a mechanical necessity. Just as an F1 engine requires cooling, your executive function requires periods of complete detachment. Here's what actually works:" },
        { type: 'p', text: "**1. Hard Stops**: Set a non-negotiable end time. No emails after 7 PM. No exceptions. Your evening hours are for nervous system downregulation." },
        { type: 'p', text: "**2. Weekly Sabbaticals**: One full day per week with zero work. No 'quick check-ins.' Complete disconnect. This is when your brain consolidates learning and repairs itself." },
        { type: 'p', text: "**3. Sleep Hygiene**: 7-8 hours minimum. Non-negotiable. Your body heals during deep sleep. Skip this, and you're building a house on sand." },
        { type: 'p', text: "**4. Movement**: Daily exercise, even if it's just a 20-minute walk. Physical activity reduces cortisol and increases BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), which repairs neural damage." },

        { type: 'h3', text: "The Counterintuitive Truth" },
        { type: 'p', text: "You think rest makes you weak. You think hustling harder is the answer. But here's the truth: **elite performers are not those who work the hardest—they're the ones who recover the best**. Look at professional athletes. They don't train 12 hours a day. They train 4 hours and rest 20. The recovery is where the growth happens." },
        { type: 'p', text: "Stop glorifying exhaustion. Stop wearing your sleepless nights like a medal. The goal isn't to see how much you can endure—it's to build a life architecture that sustains excellence without destroying you in the process. Burnout isn't inevitable. It's a design flaw. And you can redesign." }
