        { type: 'p', text: "A leader who cannot control their emotions cannot control a company. This isn't motivational fluff—it's observable reality. When Elon Musk tweets impulsively, Tesla's stock swings. When a CEO panics during a crisis, the entire organization spirals. Stoicism isn't about having no feelings; it's about not being enslaved by them. It's the ultimate operating system for high-pressure environments." },

        { type: 'h3', text: "The Dichotomy of Control" },
        { type: 'p', text: "Epictetus, a former slave turned philosopher, taught the most powerful concept in Stoicism: some things are within your control, and some are not. Your actions, your words, your judgments—these you control. The market, the critics, the outcome—these you don't. This distinction seems simple, but it's revolutionary." },
        { type: 'p', text: "Most people waste 80% of their energy trying to control things they can't. They stress about their competitor's strategy. They obsess over a bad review. They catastrophize about potential failures. All wasted energy. The Stoic redirects that energy inward: 'What can I control in this situation?' The answer is always the same—your response." },

        { type: 'h3', text: "Marcus Aurelius: The Philosopher King" },
        { type: 'p', text: "Marcus Aurelius was the most powerful man in the known world. As Roman Emperor, he could have indulged any whim. Instead, he wrote 'Meditations'—a private journal of Stoic reflections never meant for publication. In it, he reminds himself daily: 'You have power over your mind, not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.'" },
        { type: 'p', text: "Consider the weight of his role: managing an empire, constant wars, plague, betrayal by trusted advisors, the death of children. Yet he didn't collapse into bitterness or paranoia. He chose to see obstacles as opportunities to practice virtue. He didn't ask, 'Why is this happening to me?' He asked, 'What is this teaching me?'" },

        { type: 'h3', text: "Applying Stoicism to Modern Leadership" },
        { type: 'p', text: "When a crisis hits—and it will—your team doesn't need a motivational speech. They need calm. They need a leader who's already internalized that setbacks are data, not catastrophes. Here's how to embody Stoic leadership:" },

        { type: 'p', text: "**1. Premeditatio Malorum (Negative Visualization)**: Before a big decision, imagine the worst-case scenario. What if the product flops? What if the funding falls through? By pre-experiencing the fear, you defang it. When (not if) challenges arise, you're not blindsided—you're prepared." },

        { type: 'p', text: "**2. Amor Fati (Love of Fate)**: Don't just accept what happens—embrace it. Your key employee just quit? Good. Now you can hire someone better. The deal fell through? Good. It wasn't the right fit. This isn't toxic positivity—it's strategic reframing. Every setback contains a lesson or a redirection." },

        { type: 'p', text: "**3. The View from Above**: Zoom out. Marcus would imagine himself from space, looking down at the empire. His problems—massive by any standard—became tiny specks. When you're drowning in quarterly numbers or office politics, zoom out. Will this matter in 10 years? If not, don't give it 10 hours of worry." },

        { type: 'h3', text: "Emotional Regulation Under Fire" },
        { type: 'p', text: "When someone attacks you—publicly criticizes your strategy, challenges your authority in a meeting—the Stoic response isn't to strike back. It's to pause. Ask: 'Is this criticism valid?' If yes, thank them and improve. If no, it reflects their insecurity, not your inadequacy. Either way, you control your response." },
        { type: 'p', text: "Seneca advised: 'The greatest remedy for anger is delay.' Count to ten. Take a breath. Respond, don't react. The leader who can maintain composure when everyone else is panicking becomes the anchor. People don't follow the loudest voice in the room—they follow the calmest." },

        { type: 'h3', text: "Daily Stoic Practice" },
        { type: 'p', text: "**Morning Reflection**: Before the day begins, remind yourself that challenges will arise. People will be difficult. Things won't go as planned. Prepare your mind." },
        { type: 'p', text: "**Evening Review**: At day's end, reflect. Where did you lose your temper? Where did you waste energy on things you couldn't control? Don't judge—just observe. The goal is gradual improvement, not perfection." },
        { type: 'p', text: "**Memento Mori (Remember You Will Die)**: Keep death in mind. Not to be morbid, but to prioritize. Life is finite. Don't waste it seething over a bad email or postponing important conversations out of fear." },

        { type: 'h3', text: "The Stoic CEO" },
        { type: 'p', text: "Stoicism doesn't make you cold or unfeeling. It makes you unshakeable. You still care deeply—but you're not controlled by outcomes. You still feel anger—but you don't act from it. You still fear failure—but you move forward anyway. When a problem arises, you don't complain. You see it as data. You see it as an opportunity to practice patience, creativity, or courage. This is the mindset that builds empires that last." }
