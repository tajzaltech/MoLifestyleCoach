        { type: 'p', text: "We are sold a lie that happiness is the ultimate goal. Scroll through Instagram, and every ad promises joy: buy this car, take this vacation, achieve this body. But happiness is transient; it's a chemical spike that fades as quickly as it arrives. Meaning, however, is geological. It's a foundation that sustains you through life's inevitable storms. The difference isn't semantic—it's existential." },

        { type: 'p', text: "In his seminal work 'Man's Search for Meaning,' Viktor Frankl observed that those who survived the Nazi concentration camps were not necessarily the strongest physically, but those who had a 'why' waiting for them on the outside—a family to reunite with, a book to complete, a mission to fulfill. When everything was stripped away—dignity, comfort, even basic humanity—those with a sense of purpose endured." },

        { type: 'p', text: "Frankl's central insight is devastating in its simplicity: **we cannot avoid suffering, but we can choose how to cope with it, find meaning in it, and move forward with renewed purpose**. Modern life has inverted this wisdom. We are offered comfort but robbed of struggle. And without struggle towards a worthy aim, we feel empty. This is what Frankl called the 'Existential Vacuum'—a pervasive sense of meaninglessness that no amount of pleasure can fill." },

        { type: 'h3', text: "The Hedonic Treadmill" },
        { type: 'p', text: "Psychologists call it hedonic adaptation: no matter what we achieve, we quickly return to our baseline level of happiness. You get the promotion, the rush lasts a week. You buy the dream house, the novelty fades in months. This isn't a flaw in you—it's how the human brain is wired. Happiness is designed to be fleeting because it's a motivational tool, not a destination." },
        { type: 'p', text: "But meaning works differently. Meaning accumulates. Every act aligned with your core values adds depth to your life story. Raising a child with integrity compounds over decades. Building a business that solves real problems creates legacy. Sacrificing for a cause larger than yourself generates a narrative that persists beyond pleasure's ephemeral glow." },

        { type: 'h3', text: "The Three Pillars of Meaning" },
        { type: 'p', text: "Frankl identified three primary ways humans derive meaning:" },
        { type: 'p', text: "1. Creative Work: What you give to the world. This could be art, innovation, service, or craftsmanship. It's about contribution." },
        { type: 'p', text: "2. Love & Relationships: What you receive from the world through connection. Deep bonds with others anchor us to something larger than our individual existence." },
        { type: 'p', text: "3. Attitude Toward Suffering: How you face the unavoidable pain of life. This is where true character is forged. When you can't change your circumstances, you can still choose your response." },

        { type: 'h3', text: "The Practical Application" },
        { type: 'p', text: "Start defining your life not by what you enjoy, but by what you are willing to suffer for. What pain would you endure? What would you sacrifice sleep, comfort, and security for? That is where your meaning lies." },
        { type: 'p', text: "Ask yourself: If I were to die tomorrow, what would feel unfinished? Not in terms of achievements, but in terms of character. Did I love deeply? Did I contribute something valuable? Did I face my fears with courage?" },
        { type: 'p', text: "Happiness is a side effect of living meaningfully. Chase meaning, and happiness visits when you least expect it—not as a possession to grasp, but as a by-product of a life well-lived." }
