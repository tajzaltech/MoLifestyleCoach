        { type: 'p', text: "Attention is the new oil. In an economy of distraction, the ability to focus deeply for extended periods is the rarest and most valuable skill. Most people are operating in a state of continuous partial attention—checking Slack, scrolling Twitter, glancing at email—never fully present, never fully effective. They mistake motion for progress. Busy isn't the same as productive." },

        { type: 'h3', text: "The Death of Deep Work" },
        { type: 'p', text: "Cal Newport, in his book 'Deep Work,' defines it as: 'Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit.' This is how breakthroughs happen. This is how you produce work that matters. But deep work is dying." },
        { type: 'p', text: "The average knowledge worker checks email 77 times per day. The average office worker is interrupted every 11 minutes. And after each interruption, it takes 23 minutes to fully refocus. Do the math: you're not working—you're context-switching. You're training your brain to crave novelty and resist depth." },

        { type: 'p', text: "Neuroscience shows that the brain operates in 'ultradian rhythms'—cycles of about 90 minutes. During this window, you can sustain intense focus. After that, you need a break. Most people ignore this. They power through, fueled by coffee and willpower, wondering why they're mentally fried by 2 PM." },
        { type: 'p', text: "Structure your day around these blocks, not around your inbox. Work in 90-minute sprints. Then take a real break—walk, disconnect, let your mind wander. This is when your subconscious processes information and makes connections. The break isn't laziness; it's part of the creative process." },

        { type: 'h3', text: "The Four Disciplines of Deep Work" },
        { type: 'p', text: "Newport outlines four strategies to cultivate deep work:" },

        { type: 'p', text: "**1. Work Deeply**: Decide in advance when you'll work deeply. Block the time. Treat it like a meeting with your most important client—yourself. No phone. No email. No 'quick checks.' Depth requires uninterrupted time." },

        { type: 'p', text: "**2. Embrace Boredom**: Stop reaching for your phone the moment you're in line at the coffee shop. Boredom is where ideas germinate. If you can't tolerate 60 seconds of mental stillness, you've trained your brain to reject deep focus." },

        { type: 'p', text: "**3. Quit Social Media**: Controversial, but true. Social media is engineered to be addictive. Every scroll triggers a dopamine hit. You're training your brain to crave shallow stimulation. If you can't quit entirely, at least set strict boundaries. No phone before noon. No social media during work hours." },

        { type: 'quote', text: "Who you are, what you think, feel, and do, what you love—is the sum of what you focus on." },

        { type: 'p', text: "**4. Drain the Shallows**: Shallow work—email, meetings, admin tasks—will expand to fill all available time if you let it. The solution? Ruthlessly batch it. Dedicate specific blocks to shallow work and protect the rest of your day for depth. Most meetings could be emails. Most emails could be ignored." },

        { type: 'h3', text: "The Grand Gesture" },
        { type: 'p', text: "J.K. Rowling checked into a luxury hotel to finish Harry Potter. Bill Gates takes 'Think Weeks'—a full week alone in a cabin with no distractions. These grand gestures signal to your brain: this matters. Sometimes you need to change your environment to escape the pull of distraction." },
        { type: 'p', text: "You don't need a private island. But you do need separation. Work from a library. Book a coworking space. Go offline for a day. The location change resets your mental state and makes depth easier to access." },

        { type: 'h3', text: "Measuring Deep Work" },
        { type: 'p', text: "Track your deep work hours. Newport suggests aiming for 4 hours per day—that's elite-level focus. Most people achieve less than 1 hour. If you can consistently hit 3-4 hours of deep work daily, you'll outpace 95% of your peers. Not because you're smarter, but because you're training a skill they've let atrophy." },

        { type: 'h3', text: "The Deep Life" },
        { type: 'p', text: "Turn off the phone. Close the tabs. Inform your team you'll be unreachable for the next 90 minutes. Go deep. The shallow work can wait. The notifications can wait. Your potential cannot. Every hour you spend in shallow distraction is an hour stolen from the work that actually moves the needle. Choose depth. The world rewards those who can think clearly in an age of chaos." }
