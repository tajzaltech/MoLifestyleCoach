        { type: 'p', text: "By 4 PM, your ability to make quality decisions has degraded by approximately 40%. This isn't laziness—it's biological fact. Every choice you make, from what to wear to what to eat to which email to answer first, consumes glucose in the executive brain. Think of it like a phone battery: each decision drains 1%. Most people burn through 80% of their decision-making capacity before lunch on trivial nonsense." },

        { type: 'p', text: "There's a reason Mark Zuckerberg wore the same grey t-shirt every day. Steve Jobs had his black turtleneck. Obama famously said, 'I don't want to make decisions about what I'm eating or wearing because I have too many other decisions to make.' These aren't eccentric quirks—they're strategic eliminations of low-value decisions to preserve mental energy for billion-dollar choices." },

        { type: 'p', text: "You must audit your life for these 'trivial variables.' Every choice that doesn't move the needle is bleeding you dry. What you eat for breakfast. What route you take to work. What font to use in a presentation. These are energy vampires disguised as productivity." },

        { type: 'h3', text: "The Neuroscience of Depletion" },
        { type: 'p', text: "Roy Baumeister's research on ego depletion revealed something startling: willpower is a finite resource. In one famous study, participants who resisted eating freshly baked cookies gave up on difficult puzzles far quicker than those who hadn't had to exert self-control. The act of resisting the cookies depleted their cognitive reserves." },
        { type: 'p', text: "Your prefrontal cortex—the CEO of your brain—can only handle so much load. When overloaded, it defaults to one of two modes: **impulsive decision-making** (grab the quickest option) or **decision paralysis** (freeze and do nothing). Neither serves you well when making strategic choices." },

        { type: 'p', text: "Tier 1: Automate. These are recurring, low-stakes decisions. Meal prep Sunday. Set a uniform. Automate bill payments. Never think about these again." },
        { type: 'p', text: "Tier 2: Delegate. If someone else can make it 70% as well as you, let them. Your time is worth more solving Tier 3 problems." },
        { type: 'p', text: "Tier 3: Schedule. High-stakes decisions deserve dedicated time slots when your mind is fresh—typically 9-11 AM. Never make life-altering choices after 6 PM when your prefrontal cortex is running on fumes." },

        { type: 'p', text: "Never make a major decision after sunset. Your decision-making quality plummets in the evening. That's when you sign bad contracts, send regrettable emails, or agree to commitments you'll later resent. If it's important, sleep on it. Morning clarity will either confirm your intuition or save you from a costly mistake." },
